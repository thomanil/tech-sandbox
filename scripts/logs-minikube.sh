# Follow the timeline state server's logs from the minikube deployment.
#
# This is the stable entrypoint for "tail the server logs in k8s" — the rough
# equivalent of `docker compose logs -f` for the minikube path. The server logs
# client events (connects, playback commands) to stdout, which the container
# captures, so this streams the roster tables as they happen.
#
# Caveat: a follow is bound to a single pod. Re-running deploy-minikube.sh does
# a rollout that replaces the pod (Recreate strategy), which ends the stream —
# just run this again once the new pod is ready. The old pod's logs are gone
# with it; use `kubectl logs deployment/timeline-server --previous` to see the
# last terminated pod's output.

# Run from the repo root regardless of where the script is invoked from.
cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."

# Stream the logs, dropping the noisy healthcheck request lines. --line-buffered
# keeps output flowing line-by-line for the follow; grep -v's exit status is
# masked so a (transient) all-filtered chunk can't trip pipefail and kill the tail.
kubectl logs -f deployment/timeline-server --timestamps \
  | { grep -v --line-buffered "GET /healthz HTTP/1.1" || true; }
